# Description
For students, productivity is a <strong>very important</strong> virtue to strive towards, it influences how efficiently you can complete tasks (studying, assignments, etc) which will impact your GPA.
<br>
<br>
To achieve productivity, students usually lean towards using different applications that will assist them in terms of <strong>memorization</strong> (not losing track of assignments / note-taking), <strong>scheduling</strong> (some sort of calendar functionality that allows you to see where your time is going), and <strong>organization</strong> (being able to write down tasks without losing them). There are many apps that have been developed to solve these individual problems, however, these apps usually lack cohesiveness. It can be counter-intuitive as you can waste time or mental-bandwidth attempting to connect these applications to achieve a maximal amount of productivity.

ProdSync looks to solve this issue. Essentially a web application that integrates to do list, note-taking, and calendar functionality in a seamless way. An example of a key feature would be a to-do list item having an option to link to a dedicated note-space towards it. A similar use-case would be made with calendar events, where an event could have a dedicated note-space i.e. note-space containing notes for that specific class (specific meaning date-wise). Another feature would be having the tasks assigned to a given day show up in the calendar. The main appeal for this application would be all this functionality being under one application, no need to open or search for another tool as all are in one application.  

# Primary userbase
The primary user-base for this application would be students but could also appeal to working professionals attempting to save time on their tasks.
